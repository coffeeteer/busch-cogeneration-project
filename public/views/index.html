				<h2>The Virtue of Cogeneration</h2>
				<p>Industry continues to seek innovative solutions to the dual dilemmas of ever-tightening environmental regulation and ever-increasing fuel costs. Modern gas turbine technology has made enormous progress towards the related goals of reducing emissions and improving efficiency, but even these modern plant designs may suffer heat losses in excess of 70% unless cogeneration techniques are employed.</p>
				
				<p>An environmentally and economically sound method of “thermal recycling,” cogeneration captures the excess thermal energy contained in exhaust gases. A unique type of heat exchanger or Heat Recovery High Temperature Water Heater (HR-HTWH) is placed in line with the exhaust gases in place of a gas turbine, producing significant amounts of high temperature water or steam by using the hot exhaust gases in place of a boiler flame. This “waste” heat would be lost “up the stack” in more conventional designs, but with a cogeneration plant design, exhaust gases are not allowed to escape until they have been depleted of excess thermal energy.</p>

				<img src="images/boiler-stack.jpg">
				
				<p>Commercially supplied natural gas, a mix of naturally occurring methane and mercaptan, the compound added to give that distinctive “natural gas” smell, is typically used as the primary fuel source. The use of clean-burning natural gas, coupled with the efficiency inherent in a cogeneration designs yields an independent power plant which produces electricity and hot water or steam at high efficiency while producing negligible emissions.</p>
				
				<p>The following information will describe in detail how the concept of cogeneration is being implemented at Rutgers’ Busch Cogeneration Facility.</p>

				<h2>The Busch Cogeneration Project</h2>
				<p>In December 1995, the Utilities Department of Rutgers University initiated electrical generation at the Busch Cogeneration Facility. Located on the Busch campus of Rutgers University in Piscataway, NJ, this facility is the primary provider of thermal and electrical energy to both the Busch and Livingston campuses. High temperature hot water is produced for use in heating, localized steam generation, and absorption cooling, and over 13 million watts of electricity are generated for use on the Rutgers campus.</p>

				<p>Owned and operated by the State if New Jersey along with its sister plant at the University of Medicine and Dentistry (UMDNJ) in Newark, facility operations and maintenance are managed directly by the Rutgers Utilities department.  Five shift supervisors, four operating technicians, and one instrumentation and control specialist, overseen by the campus utilities manager, ensure the safe and efficient production of electricity & high temperature water 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Since the original on-line date, and despite extensive testing to improve both the reliability and performance of the plant, the Busch Cogeneration Project continues to maintain an exceptional operation availability record.</p>

				<img src="images/ctrl-rm.jpg">

				<p>The cogeneration project was constructed as an addition to the existing central heating plant in Piscataway, which now acts as a supplemental heat source for campus thermal load management. Overall project design was contracted to the engineering firm Burns and Roe, with construction management handled by Lether, McGovern and Bovis, of Princeton, NJ. Epic Inc. served as general contractor, supervising the daily work at the site. Rutgers Construction Management coordinated the activities of these companies and others to bring the project to completion.</p>

				<p>Heat production is accomplished by utilizing the high temperature exhaust of three gas turbines, manufactured by Solar Turbines, Inc., and three duct burners, manufactured by Forney Corporation, all of which consume natural gas as their primary fuel. In addition, low sulfur diesel fuel can be burned as a backup fuel when necessary. The high temperature turbine exhaust, augmented by the duct burners if necessary, is then passed over the heat recovery water heaters, manufactured by Energy Recovery International, to produce high temperature hot water.</p>

				<img src="images/hr-pumps.jpg">

				<p>The 13.5 million watts of electric power generated meets over 90% of the campus electrical need and provides a considerable monetary benefit to Rutgers by greatly reducing the amount of power which would otherwise have to be purchased. The Busch Cogeneration Facility is connected to the Piscataway/ New Brunswick power grid, which is served by the local utility PSE&G.</p>

				<p>Whether it’s heat to a student’s dorm room, steam to the serving line at the Davidson Dining Hall, or electricity to the equatorial mount on the 20 inch telescope at the Serin Physics lab, The Busch Cogeneration Facility delivers.</p>

					<h2>Facility Overview</h2>
					<p>The Busch cogeneration project was designed as an addition to the existing central heating plant. The old plant consists of one 50 Million BTU per hour and two 100 million BTU per hour high temperature water heaters like the turbines fueled either by natural gas or diesel fuel. This old portion of the total plant; as well as the pressurizers, water softeners and makeup water de-aerators required by the high temperature hot water system.</p>

					<p>The new cogeneration plant water heaters will each recover up to 25 million BTUs per hour from the turbine Exhaust, with an additional 25 million BTUs per hour available from the duct burners. This translates to a total heat output from the three turbines trains of 150 million BTUs per hour, which will maintain a 250,000 gallon water loop system at 370 degrees Fahrenheit. The resulting facility is an integrated plant with a heating capacity of 400 million BTUs per hour, with emergency plant power capability, in the unlikely event a facility wide power outage occurs.</p>

					<img src="images/cogen-facility-overview.png">

					<p>As mentioned earlier, the closed-loop High Temperature Hot Water system is maintained at a nominal temperature of 370 degrees Fahrenheit. In order to prevent boiling in the system, it is necessary to maintain the entire HTWH system above saturation pressure. Two pressurizers or expansion drums serve the purpose by maintaining the entire HTWH system at 150 psig. These drums also provide a surge volume, to compensate for expansion and contraction of the water in the system. A series of pumps circulate water through the High Temperature Water Heaters, and 5 zone pumps then distribute the hot water throughout the campus, where it will be used for heating, local steam generation, or absorption cooling, before being it’s returned to the plant to be reheated.</p>

					<img src="images/distrib-pumps.jpg">

					<p>Two zeolite water softeners provide “soft water” (water which is free of calcium and magnesium, and has a greatly reduced level of silica) to prevent system scaling which impedes system heat transfer and fluid flow.  These softeners utilize city water pressure to force the soft water into a feed tank where it is preheated, de-aerated and stored to be used as HTWH system makeup should expansion drum levels fall.</p>

					<p>The control room for the facility is strategically located between the original plant and the cogeneration addition, and is manned 24 hours a day. All major components for the facility and electrical distribution system can be monitored and controlled from this room. In addition, a Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system displays and records all vital plant parameters. This data is available for both immediate use by the operators, as well as later review and analysis by utilities management. These systems allow plant personnel instant access to all vital engineering statistics both within the facility itself and throughout the Busch and Livingston campuses.</p>

					<h2>Solar Dual Fuel Turbine</h2>

					<img src="images/solar-dual-fuel-turbine-system.png">

					<p>The Busch Cogeneration Project utilizes three Solar dual fuel turbines to convert chemical energy from natural gas of low sulfur diesel fuel into mechanical energy. In your car, this conversion from chemical to mechanical energy is typically performed by a four-stroke engine. That is, each of the four combustion processes; compression, combustion, expansion, and exhaust, occur separately. In contrast, turbines use a “Brayton Cycle” of combustion, where all four combustion processes occur simultaneously.</p>

					<p>In the Solar turbine, fuel is injected by 12 fuel injectors which are arrayed symmetrically around the combustion chamber. Combustion of the fuel creates high temperature gases, which then expand and induce mechanical rotation of the shaft through the 3 sets of turbines blades. The turbines shaft rotates at a speed of 14,951 RPMs, with a nominal combustion temperature of 1250 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

					<p>Two-thirds of the rotational energy produced is required to drive the turbines air compression stages  in order to maintain sufficient air flow through the  turbine to  support combustion. The remaining one-third of the rotational energy produced is converted to electrical energy. The 13,800 volt generator is driven through an 8.36 to 1 reduction gear that brings the 14,951 RPM speed of the turbine shaft down to 1800 RPM. The field of the generator is wound around this 1800 RPM shaft, and produces 4.5 MW of electrical power under ideal conditions.</p>

					<p> In addition to fuel and air, deioned water is fed to the combustion chamber through the 12 fuel injectors. This is done to lower the temperature of the combustion flame, which will lower NOx (Nitrogen Oxide variables) emissions in compliance with strict DEP and EPA regulation. NOx is a major factor in smog production.</p>

					<p>Perhaps the important part of the entire power train is the expansion bellows, Since there is very little practical difference between a gas turbine and a jet engine, the expansion bellows employs a Bermoulli’s principle to decrease exhaust gas velocity and therefore eliminate jet effect at the  turbine exhaust. Without this expansion bellows, the turbine would impart undue thrust against the remainder of the unit. The exhaust gases are now at approximately 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and are routed by the exhaust bellows into the second section of the train, where thermal energy will be extracted by the recovery system.</p>

				<div class="col-md-12">
					<h1>Heat Recovery System</h1>

					<img src="images/heat-recovery-system-overview.png">

					<p>As mentioned previously, the turbine expansion bellows routes the turbine exhaust to the heat recovery high temperature water heaters (HR-HTWH). The ERI HR-HTWH are used to recycle the thermal energy carried by the exhaust gases of the three Solar turbines. A pneumatically controlled flapper valve or “diverter” is employed to direct the turbine exhaust flow. The valve is controlled to vary flow across the heat transfer surfaces of the HR-HTWH in order to maintain a 370 degree Fahrenheit water temperature at the heater discharge. This 370 degree Fahrenheit water is then distributed throughout the campus.</p>

					<p>As demand on the system increases, return temperature from the system will drop. This will cause a corresponding drop in heater outlet temperature. The system will sense this and cause the Diverter to stroke towards the “open” position, directing more turbine exhaust to the HR-HTWH and less up the diverter stack. This will increase the outlet temperature until it is once again at the set point of 370 degrees Fahrenheit. At 100% “open” the diverter is porting the entire volume of exhaust through the heater. The total amount of heat generated by the turbine exhaust is 25 million BTUS per hour.</p>

					<p>Should the total thermal demand placed on the HR-HTWH exceed the 25 million BTU per hour supplied by the turbine exhaust alone, the duct burners will ignite adding an addition 35 million BTU per hour, for a maximum of 50 million BTU per hour input to the HR-HTWH  per unit. The duct burners are basically larger versions of the burner on your home gas barbecue. There are three racks for natural gas and two for diesel fuel, should this back up fuel option be necessary.</p>

					<h2>Electrical Distribution</h2>

					<img src="images/electrical-distribution.png">

					<p>The Busch Cogeneration Facility generates 13.5 Mw nominal at 13.8 KV and 60 Hz, which will supply more than 90% of the Busch and Livingston campus electrical requirements. The campus grid is connected via two transformers to the local utility PSE&G. PSE&G supplies 24.5 KV electrical power which is then stepped down to 13.8 KV at two transformers. The normal supply for the campus is the Union Carbide line, with the Metuchen grid line serving as backup. The floating power source (PSE&G) makes up for surge loads and provides blackout support. This means that even if the cogeneration plant were to accidentally come off line or be limited in its production capabilities, campus electrical supply would not be affected because the utility would automatically assume all load. This redundant arrangement gives the campus grid added protection against a loss of power.</p>

					<p>In addition to campus supply buses, the cogeneration plant itself requires some electrical supply to maintain parasitic loads. Parasitic loads are equipment which the cogeneration plant needs to startup and operate (i.e.; pumps, lights, motors, air compressors, battery chargers, etc.). To accomplish this, two transformers which tap directly off the cogeneration plant buses transform 13.8 KV to 480 V, which is then used directly by the facility or is stepped down further to 240 V or 120 V for lighting and smaller loads. Several smaller campus loads also tap directly off of these 480 V buses.</p>

					<p>Through the use of turbine generators, breakers, disconnects, and transformers, the Busch/Livingston electrical distribution system is designed to ensure a safe and reliable supply of electricity to everything form a reading lamp in a campus dorm room, to the magnetic field of a particle accelerator in the physics laboratory. In short, if it runs on electricity it is supplied from this system, so, when you turn your lights, think of us and remember… ENERGY is our business.</p>

					<h1>Injection Water Purification System</h1>

					<img src="images/water-injection-system-overview.png">

					<p>As mentioned previously, water is injected into the combustion chamber of the turbine to lower combustion temperature. This helps to reduce emissions of NOx into the atmosphere. When injected into the combustion chamber the water instantly vaporizes, leaving any impurities present in the water to bake onto the internal surfaces of the chamber. City water contains numerous electrically charged impurities of “ions” (i.e.; calcium, magnesium, silica) which will cause problems if allowed to deposit inside the turbine. For this reason, the water must be deionized.</p>

					<p>The Busch Cogeneration Project uses a water purification system manufactured by Arrowhead Inc., to condition and polish “raw” water. This is accomplished in several steps. First the water is filtered through a mixed gravel/sand bed, followed by a charcoal bed. This removes large particles and chlorine form the water. Next the water is softened via an alternating pair of zeolite water softeners, which use weak ion exchange to remove calcium and magnesium.</p>

					<p>Next, the water enters a reverse osmosis unit. Osmosis is the tendency of a liquid of lesser concentration (more pure) to pass through a semi-permeable membrane into a liquid of higher concentration (less pure). This is what happens to bathers who stay in water too long and “prune.” The fluid in their skin (a semi-permeable membrane) gives up fluid to the surrounding water. To reverse this process in the R.O. system, pressure is applied to the water via a 12 stage centrifugal pump and H2O is forced through the very fine membrane of R.O. unit, leaving all impurities behind.</p>			

					<p>In fact reverse osmosis is so effective that it will not allow alkaloids to pass through the membrane, which can cause pH to drop into the acidic range. Since a low pH is very corrosive to metals, soda ash is added to water before it enters the R.O. unit to increase pH of the water. The soda ash dissolves in the water and becomes a gas which, unlike solids will pass through the R.O. membrane, keeping pH at a safe level.</p>		

					<p>Finally, the water is “polished” through the use of a mixed bed demineralizer which uses ion exchange (similar to zeolite softeners) to remove any ions which may have escaped the R.O. system. The water is now extremely pure, and has a resistivity of 18.0 Megohms. (Pure H2O has a resistivity of 20.0 Megohms, although this is unachievable in practical terms.)</p>

					<p>The water is then stored in a tank for use by the gas turbines. It is delivered to them via a single stage centrifugal pump which supplies 32 psig head pressure to the turbines. A final conductivity check is performed to ensure purity before delivery to the turbines. The water at this point is typically &lt;2.5 umhos conductivity (pure H2O does not conduct electricity at all and would indicate 0.0 umhos).</p>

					<img src="images/ro-system.jpg">

					<p>In addition to the conductivity/resistivity of the water, silica and sodium (Si and Na) are measured at the effluent of the mixed bed demineralizer. Should a problem develop in the R.O. or the demineralizer resin exhaust, there would be the first two ions which would pass the system. Therefore, monitoring of these elements acts as an early warning system to indicate problems (additionally, silica is particularly bad for the turbine fuel injectors). In this way, we are assured of the purest possible water entering the turbine combustion chamber.</p>

					<h2>Summary</h2>

					<p>We have tried to provide a clear and concise overview of the use of gas turbines as the foundation of a cogeneration plant. Our Description of cogeneration was intentionally limited to those technologies typically implemented in association with a gas turbine plant, and in particular, a gas turbine power generation plant. As many of you know, this is but one example of the many cogeneration can be used to increase plant efficiency.</p>

					<p>Obviously, a large portion of this publication was dedicated to a detailed description of the Busch Cogeneration Facility at Rutgers University. We sincerely hope that you will find the information presented here interesting and useful. Much of the technology described here is being throughout the world, so it is by no means specific to the Busch facility.</p>

					<p>Solar Turbines, Inc. is one of the largest producers of gas turbine engines in the world, and they deserve a great deal of credit for the success of the Busch project. Despite setbacks that would have stalled a lesser company, Solar has preserved, and as a result, out on-line availability in turbine research may be obtained on the Internet at:</p>

					<p>You may learn more about Rutgers University on the internet at http://www.rutgers.edu, and you will find a link to the Busch Cogen Web Site at: http://facilities.rutgers.edu/utilities.
